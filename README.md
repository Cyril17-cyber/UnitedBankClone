# UnitedBank
Hello everyone👋🏽! I decided to make a clone of the United Bank website with a lot of functionalities also potrayed in the website such as transfer and email confirmation OTPs. 
It was made using a bunch of tools like HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, Mongodb and mongoose, bcrypt and nodemailer to send emails.
You could create an account right away and try it out for yourself.
